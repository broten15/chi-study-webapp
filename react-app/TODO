- think of a standard for the patterns format

- add searching capabilities

- clean up all data

DATA CLEAN UP:
- make algorithm to take out pinyin duplicates

how to deal with charcter duplicates???
- if pinyin cleaner finds duplicate pinyin, take out duplicate chars
  - how to know what chars to take out??
    - we know there could be a repeat chars if 2 pinyin words have a space


cleanData():
1. check if pinyin has space
  - this tells us that there could be a duplicate
2. if so, take out spaces and check if there is a repeated phrase
3. if contains repeat, take out latter half of pinyin and chars
